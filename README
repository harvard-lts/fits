This is a fork of the Harvard Library's FITS, created for the 
CURATECamp / Open Planets Foundation Hackathon and other attempts
at optimizing it. The official version of FITS is found at
(https://code.google.com/p/fits/). This fork is taken from version
0.61 on Google Code.

NOTE: This repository (under the "gmcgath" account) will be going away 
in early December. If you want to fork it or grab anything from it, 
be sure to do it soon.

Quoting from that site:

"The File Information Tool Set (FITS) identifies, validates, and extracts 
technical metadata for various file formats. It wraps several third-party 
open source tools, normalizes and consolidates their output, and reports 
any errors. FITS was created by the Harvard University Library Office 
for Information Systems for use in its Digital Repository Service (DRS)."
