We're almost finished with the 2-week project to merge the different forks of FITS on GitHub and to make it easier for others to contribute code to the FITS test base. This was done as a joint project between Harvard Library and the Open Planets Foundation with funding by the SPRUCE project. Learn more about the FITS blitz at:
